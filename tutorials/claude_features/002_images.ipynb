    "1. Residence identification: Locate the primary residence on the property by looking for:\n",
    "   - The largest roofed structure \n",
    "   - Typical residential features (driveway connection, regular geometry)\n",
    "   - Distinction from other structures (garages, sheds, pools)\n",
    "   Describe the residence's location relative to property boundaries and other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tree overhang analysis: Examine all trees near the primary residence:\n",
    "   - Identify any trees whose canopy extends directly over any portion of the roof\n",
    "   - Estimate the percentage of roof covered by overhanging branches (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%)\n",
    "   - Note particularly dense areas of overhang\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fire risk assessment: For any overhanging trees, evaluate:\n",
    "   - Potential wildfire vulnerability (ember catch points, continuous fuel paths to structure)\n",
    "   - Proximity to chimneys, vents, or other roof openings if visible\n",
    "   - Areas where branches create a \"bridge\" between wildland vegetation and the structure\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Defensible space identification: Assess the property's overall vegetative structure:\n",
    "   - Identify if trees connect to form a continuous canopy over or near the home\n",
    "   - Note any obvious fuel ladders (vegetation that can carry fire from ground to tree to roof)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Fire risk rating: Based on your analysis, assign a Fire Risk Rating from 1-4:\n",
    "   - Rating 1 (Low Risk): No tree branches overhanging the roof, good defensible space around the structure\n",
    "   - Rating 2 (Moderate Risk): Minimal overhang (<25% of roof), some separation between tree canopies\n",
    "   - Rating 3 (High Risk): Significant overhang (25-50% of roof), connected tree canopies, multiple points of vulnerability\n",
    "   - Rating 4 (Severe Risk): Extensive overhang (>50% of roof), dense vegetation against structure, numerous ember catch points, limited defensible space\n",
